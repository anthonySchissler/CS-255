# CS-255

For this venture, we worked with a fictional company called DriverPass who were trying to capitalize on the market of driving students who were failing their tests with the DMV. They wanted us to design an online system that customers could use to start and track training that would help them pass their DMV driving and written tests. This included designing a scheduling service that would allow drivers and students to have in-person driving appointemnts together.

I think I did the written aspects of this project well. I think I'm usually able to break down these concepts into ones that can be understood by a non-technical audience.

I think I would go back and revise a couple of my design documents. The hardest one for me was definitely the use-case diagram, and I think I need some more experience drafting those up. 

The user's needs are what drives the creation of the project. Not only the actual customer's that the application would be supporting, but the user needs from the perspective of the business we're supporting as well. These audiences might not always know what they need or want out of a project like this, so it's important to listen, interpret, and come back with your suggested solutions that align with what you believe the project requirements are trying to achieve. 

I always approach software design with the attitude of getting something working first, and trying to make it more efficient later. This is aided by having a greater logical focus on planning out functional software at first based off of the time constraints that we might be faced with. If I tried to "reach for the stars" when I didn't have enough time available to finish a project, then it would be a waste of the customer's time and money, as well as my own. From this class, I'll definitely be taking the techniques on building out use cases and information flows to make sure that I'm building the software for specific functionalities with consistent activity states.
